# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

Welcome! 👋

This repository is my personal space for practicing classic **data structures** and **algorithms** using **TypeScript**. While I may not use these exact patterns daily in my job, working through them helps keep my **problem-solving skills sharp**, reinforces **core programming fundamentals**, and improves my **technical fluency**.

## 📚 What’s Inside for now:

- Implementations of common data structures:
  - Stack
- Algorithms for:
  - None at the moment! Coming soon!

Each file is written to be:

- Modular and readable
- Typed using TypeScript
- Tested (where applicable)

## 💡 Why This Matters

Even though I may not need to reverse a linked list or implement a custom hash map at work, practicing these exercises helps me:

- Think algorithmically
- Write more efficient code
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Stay confident with the fundamentals

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**
- **Jest** for testing
- Node.js for running examples

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```
